                    Welcome to my website! I am Zhengyu Xia, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate from <a href="https://ees.lehigh.edu" class="link">Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Lehigh University</a>, PA. Before that, I attended China University of Geosciences in Wuhan and was awarded the degree of B.S. in Geology in 2015.<br><br> Funded by the NSF, my Ph.D. dissertation focuses on applying stable isotope techniques in peatland archives for paleoclimate reconstruction in southern Patagonia. In the first chapter, I developed a <a href="https://github.com/mscross/pysplit" class="link">PySPLIT</a>-based framework to model the influence of moisture trajectories and source regions on oxygen isotope compositions in monthly-integrated precipitation in Punta Arenas, Chile. In the second chapter, I conducted a field-based modern process study in southern Patagonian peat bogs to understand the environmental controls on the carbon and water isotope compositions in peat mosses. In the third chapter, I revisited the the oxygen isotope fractionation factor in cellulose biosythesis by using large datasets from mosses, and mainly looked into if it was independent from temperature or biased towards particular growing seasons. In the fourth chapter, I applied a dual cellulose isotope apparoach into a peat core collected from Tierra del Fuego to understand <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/46/10/855/548168" class="link">the dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds over the last 2,000 years</a>. Other than Patagonia research, I am also working on peat samples from South Georgia (in the South Atlantic Ocean) by colloborating with European geoscientsts. In early 2019, I joined a field expedition as assistant to the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/support/palmerst.jsp" class="link">Palmer Station</a> region in Antarctic Pennisula to collect plant and peat samples for an NSF project. In August 2019, I had another field trip to the Alaska North Slope to study peat patches in Arctic tundra.<br><br>My research experience and academic portofolio show I am an independent and versatile geoscience reseacher good at integrating field, laboratory, modeling, and data analysis to solve the fundemental and applied geoscience questions. I am currently looking for a postdoc position in the interdisciplinary fields of environmental geochemistry, surface processes, and paleoclimatology, starting in late spring or summer of 2020.<br><br><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7LeNjsgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" class="link">My Google Scholar profile</a>
